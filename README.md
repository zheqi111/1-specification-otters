## Stakeholders

### Charlie Burke - NYU Student<br>
**Student Goals**
Given he's on a student budget, Charlie is very keen on finding discounts around campus. On top of this, he does not want to waste time going far from campus and therefore wants to find good deals as close to campus as possible. He also likes the idea of being able to explore and fidn new restaurants that are near campus and offer good student dicsounts as he tends to be quite a habitual eater.

**Student Failures**
Charlie typically finds discounts through street signs or by asking at the register, which he finds frustrating and inconvenient. He wants a centralized place for him to easily see which restaurants offer student discounts and how far they are. He also finds himself going to the same spots every day given his lack of time in the day to explore and try find other good places. Lastly, he's not interested in mystery or surprise-based food offers and therefore platforms such as Too Good To Go do not appeal to him because he prefers predictable discounts.

### Noelia Yang - NYU Student<br>
**Student Goals**
Students actively notice restaurant window signage and advertisements that highlight student discounts. When a deal is clearly communicated and offers real value, students are likely to take advantage of it. Convenience is a major priority. Students prefer restaurants that are close to campus and easily accessible around Washington Square, especially those that fit naturally into their daily routines.

**Student Failures**
Student are generally unwilling to walk long distances solely for a discount, even if the deal is significant. Many do not actively seek out or prioritize student discounts unless they are immediately visible and easy to use. There is also resistance to “mystery bag” or surprise-based discount models, as students prefer knowing exactly what they are purchasing. As a result, students are unlikely to use apps such as Too Good To Go, particularly if the app adds extra friction or uncertainty to the dining experience.

### Derrick Li - Hashi Market<br>
**Restuarant Goals** <br>
Hashi Market already offers end-of-day discounts on ready-to-go products and provides student discounts, showing a clear effort to reduce food waste while remaining affordable. With multiple locations and an active social media presence, the brand is well positioned to attract student customers. A key overarching goal is to further minimize food waste while maintaining operational efficiency.

**Restaurant Failures**<br>
Despite these efforts, Hashi Market faces several operational challenges. Discounts are currently applied manually, which is time-consuming and limits scalability, especially during busy periods. The lack of an automated system also makes it difficult to quickly adjust or toggle discount codes on and off. Additionally, hiring remains a challenge, creating operational strain that indirectly affects waste reduction efforts.

### Tartinery<br>
**Restuarant Goals** <br>
Tartinery currently offers NYU students a discount of 10% as they want to promote students to come during the day, especially during the week when they're less busy. It's very important for them to maintain low food waste levels however they are doing a pretty good job of it currently and anything remaining is on Too Good To Go or goes directly to employees at the end of the day. 

**Restaurant Failures**<br>
Given that they already offer the NYU 10% discount and they have little food waste, Tartinery did not express to us many problems that need solving. However, they did mention that a lot of students don't realize the 10% discount and they have to ask them whether they're students to inform them of such.

## Product Vision Statement

To provide NYU students and faculty a simple and centralized mobile app that shows nearby restaurants offering student discounts, making it easier to budget and find new places.

## User Requirements
1. As a student user, I want to view nearby restaurants and markets that offer discounts or special deals on specific food items, so I can quickly choose a convenient location and know exactly what I am purchasing before pickup. 
2. As a restaurant user, I want to easily create, update, and remove discounted or promotional items, so I can quickly manage frequently changing offers without unnecessary manual effort.
3. As a student user, I want to reserve or order discounted and promotional items, including coupons, so I can secure the deal, apply the discount at checkout, and pick up my order later before the items sell out. 
4. As a restaurant, I want to list multiple discounted items with real-time availability, so students can order and pick them up before closing and I can reduce end-of-day food waste.
5. As a student user, I want to filter discounted items by distance, price, and pickup time, so I can quickly find deals that fit my schedule and location.
6. As a student user, I want to receive notifications when nearby restaurants add new discounts or increase discounts near closing time, so I do not miss good deals.
